# trackyourcongressperson
1.00 Final Project by Zach Roberts and Siddharth Sridhar

## Objective
Our objective for this project is to create tools that can help voters access, analyze, and compare the voting records of members of Congress. We at Track Your Congressperson believe that the voting record of your representatives is very important information when considering who should be re-elected to represent you, and similarly that this information is not easily accessible. We allow for the user to input their political views (whether they approve or disapprove of a vote), and the program will match up which congressperson most fits your views on issues you care about!

## Features

Our project includes numerous different features:

**Party Loyalty** - We directly compare how often each Senator votes along the lines of their party. This is represented as a percentage (%).
**Compare Records** - With user input on 2 congresspeople, up to 5 Bills that were voted on that the user cares most about, and their preferences on that bill, the algorithm compares the 2 congresspeople and outputs which one has the most shared opinions with you. This feature is especially helpful when comparing the two senators from your home state or who maybe to vote for in an upcoming election.
**Find Your Rep** - This feature allows the user to input their home state and will output the Senator's information and voting record.

### Tools Used

For this project, we coded in Virtual Studio Code in JS/HTML. We used the ProPublica Congressional API, which showed Congressional Members information and voting records. We also used the Google Material Design Lite "Dashboard" Template. MongoDB served as a way to call information from the API to use in our project.
